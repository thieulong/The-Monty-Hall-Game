# The-Monty-Hall-Game  
  
The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a (probability)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability] puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show (Let's Make a Deal) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Make_a_Deal] and named after its original host, (Monty Hall) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall].  
  
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, if you're lucky enough, you'll get the car immediately. Otherwise, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?
